# Hydrogen React

Hydrogen React is an unopionated and performant library of Shopify-specific commerce components, hooks, and utilities. Bring the best parts of Hydrogen to more React frameworks, like Next.js and Gatsby, and accelerate headless development using Shopify‚Äôs pre-built React components including Cart, Shop Pay, and Shopify Analytics.

## Versioning

Hydrogen React is tied to specific versions of the [Shopify Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/api/storefront), which follows [calver](https://calver.org/).

For example, if you're using Storefront API version `2022-07`, then Hydrogen React versions `2022.7.x` are fully compatible.

If the Storefront API version update includes breaking changes, then Hydrogen React includes breaking changes. Because the API version is updated every three months, breaking changes could occur every three months.
